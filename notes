JEST TESTING
https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started
- not quite got the hang of the file dependencies
- working when function is in standalone file e.g. sum.js, but not when a function within a file, e.g. App.js
- do we have to create a separate test for every function, as well as the file.test ???
- this can't be right - would end up with two additional new js files, for every function?!
